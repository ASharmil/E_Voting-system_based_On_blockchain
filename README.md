🗳️ Blockchain E‑Voting System
Overview
A secure, transparent, and decentralized e‑voting platform built using blockchain technology. This system ensures end-to-end verifiability while preserving voter privacy and resisting tampering.

Key Features:

Immutable ledger for auditability and transparency

End-to-end verifiability so voters and auditors can confirm votes were recorded correctly

Privacy-preserving—votes are anonymized and encrypted

Decentralized—no single point of failure or centralized authority

Smart contracts that enforce vote integrity and automate tallying

npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
🧭 Usage
Start local blockchain
Using Ganache or Hardhat (example with Hardhat):

bash
Copy
Edit
cd smart-contracts
npx hardhat node
Deploy contracts

bash
Copy
Edit
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
Start backend server

bash
Copy
Edit

[Frontend (React/Vue)] ←→ [Backend API (Node/Flask)] ←→ [Blockchain (Smart Contracts)]
                                            ↘️ IPFS (optional)
Frontend: voting UI, voter authentication, result display

Backend: interacts with blockchain, handles encryption, stores metadata

Smart Contracts: register voters, record votes, conduct tally, emit events

📜 Smart Contract Interface
Voting.sol
solidity
Copy
Edit
function registerVoter(address voter) public onlyOwner;
function vote(bytes32 encryptedVote) public;
function tallyVotes() public onlyOwner;
event VoteCast(address voter);
...
See smart-contracts/README.md for full ABI and deploy addresses.

🔒 Security & Privacy
Voter registration – controlled via owner-only functions or whitelist

Encrypted votes – using asymmetric encryption to prevent linking to voter

Event logs – used for audit while preserving anonymity

Smart contract constraints – prevent double voting and vote tampering

✅ Testing
bash
Copy
Edit
cd smart-contracts
npx hardhat test

cd ../backend
npm test

cd ../frontend
npm test
Unit tests for contracts

Backend API and encryption logic tested

Frontend UI/component tests
